  <H2>At E‐Trash Management, we provide a full suite of asset management platform to the Users to manage buy or sell their electronic waste rather than dumping it in trash.</H2>
  <H4>E‐Trash Management  can be a complex challenge, sometimes requiring multiple vendors to handle shipping, packaging, storage, inventory, data destruction, logistics, disposal and recycling.
    If not done properly, you and your company could face serious penalties for improper disposal as well as extreme data security risks.
    We can help you eliminate that risk!</H4>
